📌 What I Learned & Practiced:

Applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using real-world scenarios

Strengthened understanding of Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction

Designed problem statements before thinking about code (important mindset shift)

🧠 OOP-Based Mini System Designs:

Banking System Simulation – accounts, deposits, withdrawals, account types

Library Management System – books, borrowers, due dates, penalties

Hospital Patient Management – doctors, patients, appointments, scheduling

E-Commerce Platform Prototype – products, cart, orders, pricing logic

Student Report Card Generator – marks, grades, average, pass/fail logic
